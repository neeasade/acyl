## ACYL Icons

NOTE: if you find yourself here for some reason, checkout this fork: https://github.com/worron/ACYLS

This is a clone of ACYL (Any Color You Like) icons from pobtott's [deviant post](http://pobtott.deviantart.com/art/Any-Color-You-Like-175624910), with my personal preferences and a bash script to change the icon colors (icon.sh)

To use this (change icon colors) call like: `icon.sh "#000000"`

To see the nice interface/options to change made by pobtott, from the `scalable/scripts` directory run:

```
python2 script_gui.py
```
